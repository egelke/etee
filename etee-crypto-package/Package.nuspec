    <releaseNotes>
      This project is intended for .Net software integrators that want to produce and/or consume eHealth compliant end-to-end encrypted messages. This document applies both to end-to-end encryption for known and unknown recipients.
      eHealth is the Belgium Federal Government platform with the goal to bring all healtcare platforms in Belgium together. For more information see https://www.ehealth.fgov.be.
      This document limits itself to the usage of the .Net ETEE Library; it does not provide information about concepts and principles nor about the eHealth services, ETK Depot and KGSS. See the references where to find information about the concepts, principles and eHealth services. Since it is a library, it can only be used to integrate into an existing or new application, it has no use by its own.
